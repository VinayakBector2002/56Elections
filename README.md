# 56Elections
During the pandemic we had to conduct elections in our vidyalaya. Since it involved participation of a lot of students from various age groups, the student council had to come up with a solution that could be easily used by all and difficult to cheat. We decided to have the elections on zoom, to cater to the above mentioned problems. The students were required to turn on their videos and cast a vote in the chat box(privately messaging to the host). These chats could then be saved as text files and the programme to transverse through it count the occurrence of a particular name and save it in a dictionary, in the format {key= name: value = votes}. Even though the idea was not implemented on the ground level, since not all the members of the council were comfortable with the idea of using a computer programme to do the task.

Instead, I had to build a google sheet which would help them count the votes manually. This file had a button(green triangle) to increment the votes corresponding to the name of the student. I should mention, with just one line of code to increment the values I was able to build this sheet to function as per everyoneâ€™s liking.
